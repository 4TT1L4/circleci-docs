== Step 4: Expose Your Service

image::quickstart-step4-top.png[Step 4 of Quick Start Guide]

To expose your service outside the Kubernetes cluster, you need to tell Vamp the domain name and path you want to use.

First, choose whether you want to expose your application.

* Choose _Yes_ if your application includes a mix of services, some or all of which need to be exposed.
* Choose _No_ only if _none_ of the services should be exposed. The _No_ option is available only if you selected _NO INGRESS_ in Step 1.

If you chose _Yes_, you need to configure the following settings:

=== Domain

This is the fully qualified domain name that you want to use for your application. For example, _particles.mydomain.com_.

TIP: Applications can be exposed as either a primary domain, such as _mydomain.com_, or a subdomain, such as _app.mydomain.com_.

WARNING: Exposing multiple applications on the same primary domain or subdomain is not supported. For example, mydomain.com/app1 and mydomain.com/app2 is not supported.

=== TLS

Choose whether to use TLS to secure all external network traffic to your application.

If you choose _Terminate at the Edge_, the URL of your application will start with _https://_ instead of _http://_.

==== Secret Name

If you enable TLS, you need to provide the name of a Kubernetes Secret for the TLS certificates.

If you are using https://cert-manager.io/docs/[cert-manager] or a similar project to dynamically provision TLS certificates, use the name of the application as the certificate name, for example, _my-application-tls_.
If you already have a TLS certificate for your domain, enter the name of the Kubernetes Secret that contains the certificate chain.

==== Routes

To expose a service, you need to give it a URL path.

The default is to expose each of your services using the path name `/<service-name>`. If you want to expose your service on a different path,  you can edit the path.

If you do not want to expose a service, you can delete the route.

WARNING: If choose not to expose a service, you will be unable to use release policies that include traffic-based SLOs with that service.

When you have finished exposing your service, click **Next** in the bottom left-hand corner to save your settings.
