You can create and edit two types of metadata in Vamp: application metadata and service metadata.

== Application metadata

To access Application metadata, click the _Metadata_ tab under _Applications_.

=== Adding application metadata

To add metadata to your application, click the blue *+* icon then enter your key-value pair. When you have finished, click the blue tick icon to save your metadata.

You will see a pop-up message to confirm that your metadata has been added.

=== Deleting application metadata

To delete application metadata, click the trash icon next to the key-value pair in the list.

If you accidentally delete metadata, you can restore it by clicking the red icon next to the tick.

== Service metadata

To access Service metadata, click the _Metadata_ tab under your Service.

If you have already released a service through Vamp, you will see some CircleCI annotations.

When you have finished, click the blue tick icon to save your metadata. You will see a pop-up message to confirm that your metadata has been added.

=== Deleting service metadata

To delete application metadata, click the trash icon next to the key-value pair in the list.

If you accidentally delete metadata, you can restore it by clicking the red icon next to the tick.
