== Domains

=== Creating a Domain

To create a domain, click the the blue *+* button.

Enter the fully qualified domain name that you want to use for your application. For example, _particles.mydomain.com_.

TIP: Applications can be exposed as either a primary domain, such as _mydomain.com_, or a subdomain, such as _app.mydomain.com_.

WARNING: Exposing multiple applications on the same primary domain or subdomain is not supported. For example, mydomain.com/app1 and mydomain.com/app2 is not supported.

==== Kubernetes TLS Secret Name

If you enable TLS, you need to provide the name of a Kubernetes Secret for the TLS certificates.

If you are using https://cert-manager.io/docs/[cert-manager] or a similar project to dynamically provision TLS certificates, use the name of the application as the certificate name, for example, _my-application-tls_.
If you already have a TLS certificate for your domain, enter the name of the Kubernetes Secret that contains the certificate chain.

To create a route, click the the blue *+* button.

=== Editing a Route

To edit a path, click on the pencil icon next to the path you wish to change.

=== Deleting a Route
