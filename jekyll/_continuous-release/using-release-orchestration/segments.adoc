A segment is a group of users who share a characteristic, for example, users in the same geographical location, or those who use the same type of device to access an API.

The segments list shows the reusable user segments available for use in <<policies#,policies>>.

Vamp comes with a library of commonly used user segments, covering major web browsers and mobile devices.

It also includes example user segments that demonstrate how you can target users by their geolocation. The examples cover a range of cloud and Content Delivery Network (CDN) providers.

== Creating a Segment

To create a new segment, click the *+Create Segment* button in the top right-hand corner of the _Segments_ page.

To add more target rules, click the blue *+* button.

IMPORTANT: The rules are ANDed. This means that to match the segment, a request must match _all_ the rules.

When you have finished entering the details for your segment, click the blue *Create* button.

You will see a pop-up message to confirm that your segment has been created.

== Duplicating a Segment

To duplicate a segment, click the document icon next to it in the list. The duplicated segment appears under the original, with _-copy_ appended to the name.

IMPORTANT: If you edit a segment that is the target of a policy, the change takes effect from the _next_ release. Any active releases that target that segment remain unaffected.


== Deleting a Segment

To delete a segment, click the trash icon next to it in the Segments list. You will be asked to confirm that you wish to delete the segment. Then you will see a pop-up message to confirm that your segment has been deleted.
