Before installing the Release Agent, ensure you have all the <<../prerequisites#,prerequisites>>.

NOTE: If the application namespace does not exist, it will be created automatically during the installation.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the application namespace already exists, <<../troubleshooting#prometheus,follow these instructions>> to create a Kubernetes Secret before installing the Release Agent.

If your Prometheus instance is in a custom location, <<../troubleshooting#prometheus,follow these instructions>> before running the installer.

====

To run the installer:

. Click the *Show installation command* button.

. Run the command in your terminal

IMPORTANT: The command is only valid for 30 minutes.

If installation is successful, the status in the UI changes from _Installation pending_ to _Installation successful_ and you will see this message in your terminal:

''''

 |                                          |
 | Done!                                    |

If installation fails for any reason, the status in the UI changes from _Installation pending_ to _Installation failed_. For guidance on resolving the issue, see the <<../troubleshooting#release-agent,troubleshooting guide>>.

Alternatively, if you have the <<../using-release-orchestration/cli#,Vamp CLI>> installed and configured for your project, you can use the following command in the terminal:

[source,shell]
vamp get installer <application-name>
